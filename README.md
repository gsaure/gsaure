<h2> Hey, I'm Godwin! 🙋‍♂️ </h2>

⌨ I'm a 4th year student majoring in both software engineering and finance 💹 @[UofC](https://www.ucalgary.ca/). On my SWE side I'm really into OOP and app development, while on the business side I've been really interested data analytics, data science, and everything in between!

💼 I was a IT project delivery analytics intern this Summer @[ATCO](https://www.atco.com/en-ca.html), under Canadian Utilities Limited. I'm currently working with them on an extended part-time basis until April 2023.
